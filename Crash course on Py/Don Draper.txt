=== Early life ===
Donald Francis Draper is revealed through flashbacks to be the assumed identity of <!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME, THE CHARACTER'S BIRTH NAME IS RICHARD WHITMAN, THIS HAS BEEN CITED AND VERIFIED. CHANGING THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED VANDALISM -->Richard "Dick" Whitman,<ref>{{cite episode |title=[[Mad Men (season 3)#ep36|The Color Blue]] |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=October 18, 2009 |season=3 |number=10}}</ref> born in Illinois in 1926 to a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and an abusive, [[alcoholic]] farmer, Archibald "Archie" Whitman ([[Joseph Culp]]). His mother [[Maternal death|died in labor]], and his father was killed from a kick by a spooked horse, an accident a 10-year-old Dick witnessed.

Dick was raised primarily by a [[stepmother]], Archie's wife Abigail (Brynn Horrocks), who treated him with cruelty because she saw his very existence as a reminder of her husband's infidelity. She had a son named Adam, who was Dick's half-brother. The one person to show him any kindness as a child was "Uncle Mack" (Morgan Rusler), who taught him how to survive in the real world. Mack was "with" Abigail's sister and ran the brothel where Dick and Adam grew up after leaving the family farm.

Many years later, one of the prostitutes at the brothel had Dick and Adam [[Pickpocketing|pickpocket]] coins from trousers while she was turning tricks, to which the boys would be paid in the form of [[Hershey bar|Hershey bars]]. Don recalls eating these as the closest he ever got to a "normal childhood". Dick recalled one of his few exposures to the outside world was the story of [[Milton Hershey]] and his school for [[Orphan|orphaned children]], and wondered why he failed to qualify for such a place, considering both his parents were deceased, which made him think he was forgotten. 

During this period of his life, he began to suffer from [[croup]] and was left under the care of a prostitute named Aimée ([[Megan Ferguson]]). She took his virginity in a way that creator [[Matthew Weiner]] stated concerned "his relationship to sex and [[child sexual abuse|molestation]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/shows/mad-men/video-extras/season-06/episode-08/inside-episode-608-mad-men-the-crash |title=Inside Episode 608 Mad Men: The Crash |publisher=AMC |date=May 19, 2013 |accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> and reviewer Abigail Rine described more directly as [[rape]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Abigail|last=Rine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/don-draper-was-raped/276937/|title=Don Draper Was Raped|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=March 28, 2012|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170123155725/http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/don-draper-was-raped/276937/|archive-date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=June 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

During an enemy artillery attack Whitman causes an explosion by accident, killing Lieutenant Draper instantly. A seriously wounded Whitman switches Draper's dog tags with his own before passing out. He later awakens in a U.S. Army field hospital, presumed to be Lieutenant Draper, and is awarded the [[Purple Heart]]. He is sent home on a train with Lieutenant Draper's coffin (believed to be Private Whitman's) to offer the Army's regrets to Whitman's survivors. He avoids meeting the Whitmans at the train station but is spotted by Adam ([[Jay Paulson]]), whose parents fail to recognize him. Years later Adam tracks his half-brother down in New York, but "Draper" insists on leaving the past behind and coldly rejects him, paying him off with $5,000 in cash to keep the [[identity theft]] secret. Years later, Dick learned Adam took this so hard he hanged himself. 

Whitman begins his life anew as Don Draper, working as a used-car salesman. [[List of Mad Men characters#Anna Draper|Anna M. Draper]] ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]), widow of the real Don Draper, tracks him down. He informs her of Don's death and confesses to his masquerade. The two form a close bond that continues for many years. Anna remains a close friend and confidante until her death from [[bone cancer]] in 1965.

=== Life as "Don Draper" ===
The new Don Draper relocates to New York City, where he works as a [[furrier|fur]] salesman and attends [[City College of New York|City College]] at night. With the support of his boss, he writes advertising copy for the fur company, helping him build a portfolio along with some spec ads. It is at this job that Draper meets his future wife, [[Betty Draper|Elizabeth "Betty" Hofstadt]] ([[January Jones]]), a model who is photographed for one of his own ads. After a chance meeting at the store, he tricks a drunken [[Roger Sterling]] ([[John Slattery]]) into offering him a job at Sterling Cooper, and eventually becomes its [[Creative director|Creative Director]].

He is considered a major asset to the company, as he has considerable talent for understanding the desires of others and for effectively pitching and selling ideas. Because of this, he is occasionally courted by other advertising firms. Although he keeps his true character heavily guarded, almost everyone at the firm is portrayed as respecting his talent. At the same time, many in the firm are also troubled by Draper's erratic behavior.

[[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]])  begins her career at Sterling Cooper as Draper's secretary, but with her boss' support she becomes a [[copywriter]]. Throughout the series their relationship is portrayed as one of trust and mutual respect, even as Peggy advances in her career and eventually leaves the firm.

Draper and Betty are married in May 1953, and eventually move into a house with an address shown as 42 Bullet Park Road, [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County, New York]]. They have two children - Sally ([[Kiernan Shipka]]), born in 1954 or early 1955, and Bobby (Maxwell Huckabee), born in 1957 or early 1958.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Chrysanthemum and the Sword|series=Mad Men|serieslink=Mad Men|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|season=4|number=5|airdate=August 22, 2010|quote=In this episode, Don tells Dr. Faye Miller the ages of his children.

In December 1963 Draper convinces Bert Cooper ([[Robert Morse]]), Roger Sterling, and [[Lane Pryce]] ([[Jared Harris]]), along with Peggy Olson, [[Pete Campbell]] ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]), [[Joan Holloway]] ([[Christina Hendricks]]), and Harry Crane ([[Rich Sommer]]), to leave Sterling Cooper rather than take their chances when they learn their parent company is being purchased by rival firm, [[McCann (company)|McCann Erickson]]. They form the agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (SCDP), working out of a hotel suite before moving to the [[Time-Life Building]].<ref name="Public Relations">{{cite episode|title=Public Relations|series=Mad Men|serieslink=Mad Men|network=AMC|airdate=July 25, 2010|season=4|number=1}}</ref> Draper also leads a later merger with a rival agency. While the new agency (rebranded Sterling Cooper & Partners, SC&P) is successful, at the end of Season 6, he is forced to take "a leave of absence" from the new firm because of his erratic behavior, which costs the firm a possible advertising account with [[Hershey Chocolate]].<ref name="care">{{cite episode |title=In Care Of |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=June 23, 2013 |season=6 |number=13}}</ref>

Draper works as a freelancer for a year while still technically on SC&P's payroll. Megan has moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career, and asks him for a divorce. Feeling guilty over his past infidelities, Draper gives her a generous divorce settlement. SC&P eventually allows him to come back on the condition that he stops drinking on the job. He does his work well and eventually assumes his old position with the company. Following Bert Cooper's death, Roger Sterling, with Draper and other partners' support, sells SC&P to McCann as an independent and separate subsidiary. The arrangement lasts for a year before McCann decides to fully absorb SC&P. McCann's executives groom Draper as management material, but he panics at the thought of being tied down and leaves the company in the middle of a meeting.

Draper embarks upon a nomadic existence as a mechanic, and in the series' final episode, "Person to Person", moves into a commune with Anna's niece Stephanie ([[Caity Lotz]]). In the last scene of the episode and series, he sits and meditates, with a smile on his face.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Person to Person |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=May 17, 2015 |season=7 |number=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ashley|last=Lee|url=http://time.com/3891861/mad-men-finale-don-draper-jon-hamm-matthew-weiner-coke-ad-recap/|title=Don Draper Wrote That Coke Ad, After All|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123160933/http://time.com/3891861/mad-men-finale-don-draper-jon-hamm-matthew-weiner-coke-ad-recap/|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref> His ultimate fate is left ambiguous: in their reviews of the final episode, some critics said that the episode's final shot—the iconic "[[I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke]]" ad, produced by McCann Erickson—implied that the episode did not provide a definite ending to Draper's story, while others noted that Peggy's last conversation with Don was a phone call inviting him to work with her on a new client she just landed, Coca-Cola, suggests Draper returned to advertising and created that commercial.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Shirley|last=Li|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/18/mad-men-series-finale-reviews-are|title=Here's what everyone wrote about the Mad Men finale|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}</ref>
